#### My thoughts on CV


Thank you for reviewing my CV. I have the following thoughts (and concerns) on my CV.


1. My area of interest:
    Randomized algorithm
    Optimization
    Machine learning

    (Should I put these on my CV?)

1. The "skills" at the end:
    I have found this section on a lot of people's CV's. I can fit it into a single page, but does that add values to my CV?

1. Work experience:
    Are my work experiences valuable for mentioning? Should some of them be removed? 
    Aside from the ones I put on the CV, I also had an exprience as a Frontend developer. I did not include it because I think it's irrelevant to what I wanted to do.

1. Coursework:
    Should I include this section? I have seen this in undergrads' CV's. This might highlight some of my skills when I don't have strong research projects.
    Should I include my grades for these classes?

Also, any other suggestion is welcome.
